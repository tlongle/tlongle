 <!-- About section -->

---
âœ¨ I'm a frontend engineer, graphic designer, music producer, and follow a slew of other hobbies, like gaming and photography.<br>
ðŸ’» I started programming in 2020, learning with C# and WinForms, and eventually learned ASP.NET in school, which made me enjoy
web programming even more than regular apps.
